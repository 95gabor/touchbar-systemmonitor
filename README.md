# Project curiosity "#iorestoacasa -> #stayathome"

In March 2020, I began working on this project in my nights to contrast my feeling bad during the isolation caused by the Pandemic Influenza of COVID-19 in Italy :-( 

This project aims to send a message to all people that have unfortunately have to fight the COVID-19. All of us can contribute to breaking the outbreaks by staying at home. If we really have passionate about somethings we can find more time to do what we love. 

**We must remember and/or understand that a pandemic eventually ends, the problem is when and how.** 

This is my personal small (or useless) contribution (better say message) to help the community to understand better the importance of social interventions in case of a pandemic.
